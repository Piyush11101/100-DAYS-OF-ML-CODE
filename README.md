# Day 1
# Data Preprocessing
1) Importing .csv Dataset using pandas library
2) Fixing the missing values using sklearn(0.22.1) library SimpleImputer
3) Doing labelEncoding and OneHotEncoding using sklearn.preprocessing library
4) Splitting of dataset into train and test using test_train_split function of sklearn.model_selection library
5) Standardization of data using preprocessing.StandardScaler() from sklearn library

# Day2
# Simple Linear Regression

Simple linear regression is a statistical method that allows us to summarize and study relationships between two continuous (quantitative) variables:

One variable, denoted x, is regarded as the predictor, explanatory, or independent variable.
The other variable, denoted y, is regarded as the response, outcome, or dependent variable.

1) Data preprocessing
2) Applying Simple Linear Regression Model
3) Predicting the result
4) Visualization

# Day3
# Multiple Linear Regression

Multiple linear regression (MLR), also known simply as multiple regression, is a statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable. The goal of multiple linear regression (MLR) is to model the linear relationship between the explanatory (independent) variables and response (dependent) variable.

1) Data Preprocessing
2) Avoiding Dummy Variable Trap
3) Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set
4) Fitting Multiple Linear Regression to the Training set
5) Predicting the test set result

# Day4
# Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable, although many more complex extensions exist. In regression analysis, logistic regression (or logit regression) is estimating the parameters of a logistic model (a form of binary regression).

1) Data Preprocessing
2) Splitting the Data
3) Feature Scaling
4) Fitting Logistic Regression to the Training set
5) Predicting the Test set results
6) Evaluating The Predection
